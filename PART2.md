## Problems Encountered & Solutions
1. Problem: The Zombie Move and Attack part.
   Solution: After several failed attempts in trying to compile it, Me and Kai Zheng finally found out that it was actually just the system("pause") & system("cls") were not added in, so the changes were not seen easily. After added in, it was working perfectly!
